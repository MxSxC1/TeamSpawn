MxSxC1 - 5 Minute Challenge (not done one in several years).

Challenge - Create A Data Pack In 5 Mins To Set 2 Spanw Points For 2 Teams

As always it's not pretty when done in 5 mins.

It's not good, and is hard coded, but was a very quick attempt to help someone, and show people can this CAN be done in 5 mins...even if it's not ideal.

And you don't need mods to do it...

Will be done properly later with Markers, team spreading, later will import the code we use for The Arena, resetting home spawn points and using storage and doing it properly.
